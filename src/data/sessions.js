Modeling these systems present many challenges as they exist in a high-dimensional phase-space plus time. We are interested in applying a micro-macro decomposition method to the Vlasov equation paired with multiple collision operators in order to capture the important effect that collisions have in a plasma. The operators of interest include the famed Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK), Lenard-Bernstein operator (LBO), and the Fokker-Planck operator. We will walk through the decomposition method and some numerical results."

The scheme computes a polynomial approximation of the solution via Legendre collocation and reconstructs the state variables by integrating this approximation consistent with the prescribed initial data. To provide a fair evaluation, we adopt benchmark parameter sets from the literature and compare against the Laplace--Adomian decomposition method, the variational iteration method, the modified VIM , and a classical Runge--Kutta solver. Even at modest polynomial degrees (e.g., N=8), Legendre collocation yields consistently smaller residuals of the governing equations for T, I, and V, and produces trajectories that closely track reference solutions. Accuracy is comparable to or better than competing approaches. These findings support Legendre collocation as a reliable, easy-to-implement alternative for precise simulation and benchmarking of nonlinear ODE systems in virus dynamics."

Optimal transport has proven to be an effective tool for various applications with such data, such as multi-omics integration. In this talk, we will discuss several optimal transport variants motivated by the biological applications, where there are detailed application-specific constraints, multiple distribution species, and multiple embedding spaces of the same system. We will illustrate the applications of these tools for addressing multi-compatible molecular species in cell-cell communication analysis and devising coherent trajectories of the same biological system from multi-omics datasets."

        "abstract": "We present an enriched immersed finite element (IFE) method for 3D interface problems with general non-homogeneous jump conditions. Our approach introduces a homogenization concept, constructing trial functions from a standard homogeneous IFE space enriched by functions determined directly from jump data, without increasing degrees of freedom. The homogeneous IFE space is isomorphic to the standard finite element space, with stability independent of interface location. This property ensures optimal conditioning and enables a multigrid fast solver whose iteration counts remain independent of mesh size and interface position. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments confirm these advantages."

Mapping activity patterns according to cell feature preference reveals \"bumps\" predictive of behavioral responses and continuum neural field models are oft used to explore single-trial response errors in delayed estimation tasks. However, these models may ignore the removal of information and memory remnants that could impact subsequent trials. Inspired by data on forgetting, we mechanistically model intertrial activity where we incorporate (1) passive forgetting via increased internal noise to 'clear the slate,' (2) an active forgetting variable for more conscious task-dependent removal of information, (3) the possibility of 'overwriting' prior memories, and (4) short-term presynaptic facilitation that allows for ghosts of information to linger. Through this tunable model, we study sequences of trials and compare with behavioral data to explore how balancing these mechanisms may improve/worsen response errors."

While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a mesh-free alternative for solving PDEs, their fractional counterparts (fPINNs) face critical limitations: (1) high computational cost in evaluating fractional derivatives and (2) loss of solution positivity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates the modified fast L1 (MFL1) algorithm into fPINNs for solving time-fractional convection-diffusion equations, enabling efficient and robust computation of Caputo fractional derivatives, while preserving solution non-negativity—an essential property for physical consistency."
